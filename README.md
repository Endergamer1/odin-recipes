# odin-recipes
This simple HTML design is made for showing off Recipes to see which ingredients are needed and what steps to make them. 
It uses Unordered lists to store the ingredients and Ordered Lists for the Steps. 
It also utilises linking to different files so that you can go to the recipes from the start page and also go back. 
Image links are also used to add a picture of the finished product.
